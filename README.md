Project Title

I've been working on a Shapable ImageView that allows users to display images in different shapes—circle, rounded rectangle, cut corners, and more! 🖼️✨

Using Material Components, I was able to achieve smooth and dynamic shape transformations effortlessly. This can be useful for profile pictures, UI enhancements, and creative layouts in Android apps.
